# Unity-Audio-Scripts
Hello,

This is a collection C# scripts I use for implementing audio in Unity either using Unity's native audio engine or FMOD. I'm frequently adding and tweaking things here.
Feel free to use the stuff from here on any project you want.

Enjoy and le tme know if you ahve any questions on how to use these scripts.
