# Unity-Audio-Scripts
Hello,

This is a collection scripts I use for implementing audio in Unity. I routinely use these scripts in my work and I think other people might also find it useful. Also this is pretty much an ever going work in progress, with me constantly tweaking and addding scripts as the need arises.

**Feel free to use any of these scripts in any project, commercial or not.**
